# ‚öôÔ∏è Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Template Repository

This repository serves as a robust, standardized template for deploying applications and managing cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. It is structured to facilitate rapid deployment, easy configuration management, and consistent environment setup across projects.

## ‚ú® Template Structure

This template includes a standardized directory structure to separate concerns between configuration, deployment logic, and environment-specific parameters:

config/: Contains core configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON) that define application settings and shared parameters.

deployments/: Holds environment-specific IaC files (e.g., Terraform plans, CloudFormation templates, or Kubernetes manifests) for staging, production, etc.

bic/: (Specific subdirectory for project-related internal components or business logic code, if applicable.)

.gitmodules: Configured for managing external dependencies as Git submodules (e.g., reusable IaC modules or common libraries).

cf-eu12-it-iac-prov_update_cpi.yaml: An example of a CloudFormation or similar provisioning file used for environment updates.

## üöÄ Key Features

Rapid Project Start: Use this repository as a starting point (Use this template) for any new IaC project.

Git Submodule Support: Pre-configured to easily link and manage external, reusable IaC modules via .gitmodules.

Configuration Separation: Clear division between application logic, configuration files, and deployment pipelines.

Environment Consistency: Provides a blueprint for defining and maintaining consistent infrastructure across development, staging, and production environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Clone the Repository (with Submodules):

Bash

git clone --recurse-submodules <REPO_URL>

Initialize Submodules (if cloning without --recurse-submodules):

Bash

git submodule update --init --recursive

Customize:

Update configuration files in the config/ directory.

Define your specific resource provisioning in the deployments/ directory.

Rename the example files (cf-eu12-it-iac-prov_update_cpi.yaml) to match your project needs.

## ü§ù Contributing

This template is maintained for reuse. Contributions to improve structure, documentation, or add best-practice examples are welcome.
